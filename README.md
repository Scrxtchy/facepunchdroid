# Facepunch Droid
The all amazing app for the best forum Facepunch.

Use Facepunch with a more mobile friendly design, and features.

If you don't trust me, you are more than welcome to build the app yourself.

## Features:
- Material Design 
- Native image viewer 
- Download images directly from image viewer
- Mobile friendly design 
- Custom themes 
- Open-source
- Pin threads to drawer
- Easy access to all the important pages everywhere like, Read Threads, Popular etc.. 

## Making custom stylesheets for Facepunch Droid
It works the usual way CSS works. 

**NOTE: You have to escape quotes like so:**

    .someclass {
      content: \"something\";
    }
It's only needed until I fix the way I add the custom stylesheet.

**UPDATE!**
Not needed anymore, as I have updated the injection method
