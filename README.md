## Q&A
**Q:** You're probably wondering, how is this app going to survive more than the other versions?

**A:** My app doesn't rely on an API, it simply injects some styling to the website, to make it more mobile friendly, and do other stuff more natively. So as long Facepunch is up, my app will continue to work, unless they start to change the HTML to much (This is easily fixed though)

---------

**Q:** WTF?!?! WHY HAVEN'T YOU FIXED THIS/WHY HASN'T THERE BEEN AN UPDATE IN A WHILE

**A:** Please note, I can only work on the app in my spare time, which is already pretty limited. I can usually work on the app from/to work, or if I'm lucky a little bit when I'm home, I have a wife that would like to see me too. I also work for free, and purely from interest.

---------

**Q:** What if Google Play pulls the app?

**A:** No problem, I will simply host it myself, and make a built-in updater (Which isn't allowed on Google Play ATM)
